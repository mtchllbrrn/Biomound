# Biomound

Biomound is a computer model simulating the evolution of desert topography. The model simulates the diffusive rain transport (the primary agent of topographic evolution in the area of study) and the input of a biologically-informed shrub population. Ultimately, the model hopes to answer a simple question: Is there a topographic signature of life?

This model was built with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).
